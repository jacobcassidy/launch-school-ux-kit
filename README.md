## Quickstart Guide

1. Install the [Tampermonkey](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) browser extension (or an equivalent extension).
2. Open the Tampermonkey extension's dashboard.
3. Click on the dashboard's `+` tab to create a new script.
4. Copy the code from [/dist/js/index.min.js](https://github.com/jacobcassidy/launch-school-ux-kit/blob/main/dist/js/index.min.js), then paste it into the Tampermonkey editor and save it (`CMD + S`).
5. Go to [launchschool.com](https://launchschoo.com) or refresh the page if you're already there and the script should now be active (if not, check your Tampermonkey extension settings to make sure it's active on launchschool.com).

> [!TIP]
> If you want the clean look from the screenshots (no URL bar, tabs, browser nav, etc), do the following:
>
> 1. Open launchschool.com in the Safari browser.
> 2. Select `File > Add to Dock...`
> 3. Make the title "Launch School" and click "Add".
> 4. Open the new Launch School Safari app you just created.
> 5. Open settings (in the menubar, click `Launch School > Settings` or use the `CMD + ,` hotkey).
> 6. In the Setting's "General" tab, deselect "Show navigation controls".
> 7. In the Setting's "Extensions" tab, click "Browse Extensions" and install "Tampermonkey" (or an equivalent extension).
> 8. Then follow the rest of the [Quickstart Guide](#quickstart-guide) above to complete the setup.

- Adds hotkeys to toggle the visibility of all toggleable panels (header, menus, sidebar, and tabs), so you can display only want you need for minimizing distractions.

- You can toggle the userscript off at anytime and reload the page to get the original official UX back.
- This kit modifies the existing DOM of launchschool.com. If the launchschool.com DOM changes in the future, this skit may cease to function. If that happens, please [report the issue](https://github.com/jacobcassidy/launch-school-ux-kit/issues).
